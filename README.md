# Peddecord Photo

Decided to create a universal/isomorphic and generally overly-engineered photography portfolio website for myself. Based on [this](https://github.com/DominicTobias/universal-react) lovely starter kit.

### Tech Stack

You can hit the aforementioned link or you can look at this list:

* Express
* React
* React Router
* Redux

### Motivation

* Needed a new website, wanted an web-app
* But I wanted SEO too
* And universal/isomorphic JavaScript is [!fun!](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.34:Losing)
